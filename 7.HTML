    <h1>Programing Quates</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>It's better to wait for a productive programmer to become available than it is to wait
            for the first available programmer to become productive.
        </li>
        <li>Everyday life is like programming, I guess. If you love something,
             you can put beauty into it.
             </li>
        <li>A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.</li>
        <li> Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who 
            knows where you live.</li>
        <li> Bad programmers worry about the code. 
            Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.
        </li>
    </ul>
